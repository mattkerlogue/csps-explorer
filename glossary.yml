- term: agency
  refers_to: organisation
- term: civil servant
  definition: |
    An official employed by the Crown that works in the UK
    [Civil Service](#civil-service).
- term: Civil Service
  id: civil-service
  definition: |
    The term "Civil Service" means the
    [UK Civil Service](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/civil-service),
    that is the body of officials employed by the Crown that work in departments
    and agencies of the UK's central government, the Scottish Government and the
    Welsh Government. Historically, it has been called the *'Home Civil Service'*.
    The vast majority of civil servants working for the UK Civil Service are
    invited to take part in the survey[^participation].
    
    [^participation]: Very small organisations are not obliged to participate
      in the People Survey. Some civil servants provide secretariat services to
      advisory bodies that are independent of government, in most cases these
      staff participate in the People Survey through their 'home department'
      (as they are employed by the government that 'sponsors' the advisory
      body) however in some cases these staff do not participate in the survey.
    
    The Diplomatic Service are the combination of Crown employees working for
    the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office and staff employed locally
    by British diplomatic missions and posts (e.g. High Commissions, Embassies
    or Consulates). Staff of the diplomatic service, both FCDO Crown employees
    and those locally employed, participate in the People Survey.

    Unlike the Scottish and Welsh Governments, the Northern Ireland Executive is
    supported by a legally separate body of civil servants called the Northern
    Ireland Civil Service. Staff for the Northern Ireland Civil Service do not
    participate in the People Survey. Staff of UK government departments or
    agencies based in Northern Ireland do participate in the survey as they are
    UK civil servants.
- term: Civil Service People Survey
  id: civil-service-people-survey
  definition: |
    The [Civil Service People Survey](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/civil-service-people-survey-hub)
    is the annual employee attitudes survey of civil servants working in the UK
    [Civil Service](#civil-service).
- term: core questionnaire
  see_also:
    - variable-term
    - demographics
  definition: |
    The bulk of the People Survey uses a common questionnaire seen by all
    respondents no matter which [organisation](#organisation) they participate
    through, this is called the 'core questionnaire'. Some items of the core
    questionnaire use ['variable terms'](#variable-term) that adapt the language
    of the question so that it reflects the organisational context of the
    respondent. In addition to the core questionnaire organisations can chose
    a small number of additional 'local' questions bespoke to their needs, these
    are not included in the central datasets published by the Cabinet Office.
- term: CSPS
  id: csps
  definition: |
    'CSPS' is a commonly used acronym to refer to the Civil Service People
    Survey. Like many terms used in the Civil Service/government this acronym
    is not unique. In the context of this companion and the data processing it
    describes, 'CSPS' is only used to refer to the Civil Service People Survey.

    The other main use in the context of the management of the Civil
    Service is the Civil Service Pension Scheme (also 'CSPS', all capitalised).

    Elsewhere in government, Community Safety Partnerships (local partnerships
    of public service organisations in England and Wales) and Co-ordinated
    Support Plans (a legal support plan in Scotland for children with
    long-term, multiple or complex support needs) can both be referred to using
    the acronym 'CSP' and is pluralised as 'CSPs' (note the lower-case 's').
- term: demographic questions, demographic categories
  id: demographics
  see_also:
    - core-questionnaire
  definition: |
    In addition to attitudinal questions the People Survey includes a number of
    'demographic' questions that allow the results of the survey to be broken
    down by different characteristics of respondents. The demographics are split
    in to two major groups: work-related characteristics such as a respondent's
    [grade](#grade), their working location or the type of role they do; and,
    personal characteristics such as a respondent's [sex](#sex-and-gender),
    their age or whether they have childcare responsibilities. Individual
    responses to demographic questions are referred to as 'demographic
    categories'.
- term: department, departmental family, departmental group
  refers_to: organisation
- term: EEI, EES
  refers_to: engagement-index
- term: employee engagement
  id: employee-engagement
  definition: |
    The concept underlying the measurement framework for the Civil Service
    People Survey. There is no singular definition of employee engagement,
    however @Baileyengagement2015 notes that many definitions have developed as
    a result of the "positive psychology" movement. In regards to the People
    Survey, the @cspsqualityinfo2024 describes employee engagement as:

    > a workplace approach designed to ensure that employees are committed to
    > their organisation's goals and values, motivated to contribute to
    > organisational success, and are able at the same time to enhance their
    > own sense of well-being.
- term: employee engagement index
  id: engagement-index
  see_also:
    - employee-engagement
    - theme-scores
  definition: |
    The Civil Service People Survey measures
    [employee engagement](#employee-engagement) through an 'employee engagement
    index' (often simplified to 'engagement index'), which is calculated from
    five questions that individual respondents levels of "pride, advocacy,
    attachment, inspiration and motivation" with their organisation
    [@cspsqualityinfo2024]. The index is calculated such that a score of 0%
    reflects all respondents answering 'strongly disagree' to all five
    questions, and a score of 100% reflects all respondents answering
    'strongly agree' to all five questions.

    The employee engagement index is sometimes referred to by the acronym EEI
    (for employee engagement index) or EES (for employee engagement score).

- term: grade
  id: grade
  definition: |
    Changes in 1991 and 1996 ended the collective pay and grading system in use
    across the Civil Service and government departments were given flexibility
    to set their own salary scales [@holpublicservice1998], often called
    'grades'. For coordination purposes these departmental grades are aligned
    into a cross-Civil Service framework of seven broad grades [@cscareers2026].
- term: machinery of government change
  id: mog-change
  see_also:
    - organisation
  definition: |
    A 'machinery of government change' or 'MoG' change (typically pronounced
    "mog change") is the common term used for the transfer of functions between
    different government/public service [organisations](#organisation).

    Machinery of government changes present complications in analysing People
    Survey time-series data as government departments and executive agencies
    can be created, merged, split. While many MoG changes are visible in the
    published data (typically through changes in organisation name), some MoG
    changes involve the transfer of functions between existing organisations
    without any visible external changes to organisation names/labels.

    Machinery of government changes and their implications for the People
    Survey are discussed further in the chapter on
    [harmonising organisations](12_organisations_regex.qmd).
- term: ministry

  refers_to: mog-change
- term: non-departmental public body
  refers_to: organisation
- term: non-ministerial department
  refers_to: organisation
- term: organisation
  id: organisation
  definition: |
    The organisational structure of the UK Civil Service is not simple and nor
    is it formally codified. While there are aspects common to the experiences
    of civil servants and all are required to follow the Civil Service Code.
    The UK Civil Service is not a single employer, rather it is the government
    department or agency that is the employer of individual civil servants.

    The People Survey is designed to support this flexibility as questions in
    the core questionnaire include a ['variable term'](#variable-term) that
    ensure respondents see terminology specific to their context rather than
    use a generic term like 'organisation' or 'department' that may cause
    confusion. Organisations also have the option to include bespoke local
    questions in addition to the survey's core questionnaire.

    In this context, individuals participate in the People Survey through one
    of around 100 'organisations'. These agencies typically align with
    individual government departments and agencies, however in some cases staff
    in agencies are surveyed as part of their parent department, in other cases
    for a department may have additional 'organisations' that split out a
    specific group of staff for operational reasons. Individual organisations
    are grouped into departmental groups (sometimes referred to as 'families').

    The nature of the Civil Service's organisational structure, and its
    implications for the People Survey is discussed further in the chapter on
    [harmonising organisations](12_organisations_regex.qmd).
- term: pay band, pay scale

- term: regular expression
  id: regular-expression
  definition: |
    A [regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression)
    (often called a 'regex') is a method for pattern matching in text. They are
    used in the People Survey to identify attitudinal questions, demographic
    questions and categories, and organisation names within the People Survey
    datasets.

    See the [introduction to harmonisation](10_harmonisation.qmd) for further
    details on how regular expressions are used in the processing of People
    Survey data.
- term: regex
  refers_to: regular-expression
- term: responsibility level
  refers_to: grade
- term: sex and gender
  id: sex-and-gender
  definition: |
    Over the years of its operation there have been several changes to the way
    the People Survey has measured sex, gender and gender identity. These
    questionnaire changes and the particular choices made to harmonise People
    Survey data over time are discussed in a dedicated
    [appendix](99_demographics_sex_gender.qmd).
- term: theme scores
  id: theme-scores
  see_also: engagement-index
  definition: |
    Alongside the [engagement index](#engagement-index), the survey results 
    include a set of 'theme scores' which provide a summary score for the nine
    main themes of the survey's questionnaire. Theme scores reflect the level
    of positive response to the questions in the given theme, that is 'strongly
    agree' or 'agree' answers. Theme scores are calculated on a per respondent
    basis and as a result of missing data (i.e. if a does not answer all
    questions in a theme) theme scores may not match a simple mean of the
    published percent positive scores for a theme.
- term: variable term
  id: variable-term
  see-also: core-questionnaire
  definition: |
    The [core questionnaire](#core-questionnaire) is seen by all respondents to
    the survey, however to ensure questions are clear some questions include
    'variable terms' which replace a generic term with terms that are bespoke
    to the specific organisation. As of 2024 the only variable terms are 'my
    organisation' and 'your organisation', which are substituted with the
    organisation's actual name (or in some cases acronym, such as 'HMRC' for
    staff in HM Revenue and Customs).

    The question on [grade](#grade) can be considered a special variation of
    the variable terms as it is part of the core questionnaire but the options
    are bespoke to each organisation's grade structure. In practice each
    organisation has a separate grade question for their respondents and the
    answers are then matched to the Civil Service's common grade framework.
- term: UID

    - organisation
    - demographics
  definition: | 
    A unique identifier (UID) is a code that refers to a specific item.

    In the context of the People Survey processing there are three sets of
    UIDs that have been implements: UIDs for attitudinal questions and measures;
    UIDs for organisations; and, UIDs for demographic questions and categories.

    In the context of this companion the term 'repository', often shortened
    to 'repo', typically means a collection of software code managed through
    a version control system such as [git](#git) and often stored in a cloud
    service such as [Github](https://www.github.com).
- term: git
  id: git
  definition: |
    A distributed version control system for managing source code and data.
