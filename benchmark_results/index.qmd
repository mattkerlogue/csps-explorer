The Civil Service benchmark is calculated for each measure as the
median score of the participating organisations - half of organisations will
score above this figure and half of organisations will score below this figure.
The figures for [all respondents](all_respondents/index.qmd) are also available.

## Headline results

The People Survey's headline results focus on measuring employee engagement
and it's key drivers. The employee engagement index is based on five questions
that measure civil servants' levels of advocacy for, attachment to and
motivation towards the civil service organisation they currently work for.

In 2024 the Civil Service benchmark for employee engagement 64%, unchanged
from 2023.

The engagement index is calculated as a weighted average of the
five questions that make up the index. An index score of 0% represents all
respondents answering strongly disagree to all five questions while a index
score of 100% represents all respondents answering strongly agree to all five questions.

### Drivers of engagement

The People Survey measures nine 'themes' that are drivers of employee
engagement. The summary cards below show the overall score for each theme, the difference from last year and the long-term trend from 2009 to
2024.

All themes have an influence on levels of employee engagement, but some have
stronger associations with levels of employee engagement than others. Next to
the name of each theme is a small signal-bar icon indicating the strength of
association between that theme and the engagement index.

:::{.callout-tip title="Theme score calculation, driver analysis and the signal-bar symbols" collapse="true"}

The strength of association is derived from a combination of factor analysis
and regression modelling of the published results. The factor analysis is
related to the grouping of questions into themes based on their correlation
with each other. The regression analysis assesses how correlated each factor
is with the engagement index, the output from this analysis is then used to
determine the strength of association between the factor and the engagement
index.

| Icon | Description |
| -: | :------------------------- |
| [{{< iconify skill-level-advanced title="Strong association icon" label="Strong association icon" style="color:#1192e8;" >}}]{.driver-strength} | **Strong association:** if scores in these themes are low then prioritise action in these areas to improve employee engagement. |
| [{{< iconify skill-level-intermediate title="Moderate association icon" label="Moderate association icon" style="color:#1192e8;" >}}]{.driver-strength} | **Moderate association:** while not as direct as the first three drivers these themes still have a notable impact, they're often important for maintaining high levels of employee engagement. |
| [{{< iconify skill-level-basic title="Weak association icon" label="Weak association icon" style="color:#1192e8;" >}}]{.driver-strength} | **Weak association:** these themes have background influence on levels of employee engagement, keep a watch to make sure they don't drop.

## Question results: overview

The engagement index and theme scores are headline scores that provide a quick
overview of the People Survey results, these scores are derived from the
results of individual questions. The rest of this report provides an overview
of the results of each question in the survey, grouped by survey section and
theme.

Overall we divide the survey results into four broad sections:

* [Employee engagement and core themes](#question-results-employee-engagement-and-core-themes)
* [Future intentions](#question-results-future-intentions)
* [Discrimination, bullying and harassment](#discrimination-bullying-and-harassment)
* [Wellbeing](#question-results-wellbeing)
* [Other questions](#question-results-other-questions)

Unless otherwise stated results are the percentage responding 'strongly agree'
or 'agree' to the statement/question.

### Biggest increases

The benchmark figures are calculated as the median score across all
participating organisations for each separate measure. For the questions on
future intentions each question response is treated as a separate measure, as a
result the net sum of differences may not be zero due to the underlying
variation in organisation scores.

Depending on the nature of your interest in this question, the results for
[all respondents](all_respondents/index.qmd) may be more relevant than the
Civil Service benchmark.

## Question results: Discrimination, bullying and harassment

The People Survey asks civil servants if they have experienced either
discrimination, or bullying or harassment in the past 12 months. For those
that say they have the survey goes on to ask some follow-up questions to
better understand the nature of their experiences.

### Discrimination at work

> Discrimination is when an employer treats an employee less favourably than
> someone else, or  when a working condition, policy, procedure or rule
> disadvantages one group of people more than another.

## Question results: Wellbeing

Alongside measures of employee engagement and other experiences of work the
People Survey includes a number of questions about individual's general
wellbeing, some of the other non-wellbeing questions have also been used to
calculate specific 'wellbeing' indexes'.

* [Personal wellbeing](#personal-wellbeing): the ONS's four questions measuring
  [personal wellbeing](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/wellbeing/methodologies/personalwellbeingsurveyuserguide)
* [Wellbeing indexes](#wellbeing-indexes): existing core/non-wellbeing questions
  in the survey are used to calculate two wellbeing specific indexes (PERMA and
  Proxy Stress).
* [Other wellbeing questions](#other-wellbeing-questions): the survey also asks
  respondents a few additional questions about mental and physical health.

:::{.callout-note title="Subjective wellbeing scales" collapse="true"}
Respondents answer the four subjective wellbeing questions by giving a rating
from 0 to 10 where 0 is equivalent to 'not at all' and 10 is 'completely', for
example with the question on life satisfaction a score of 0 means 'not at all 
satisfied' while 10 means 'completely satisfied'.

Based on the approach taken by the ONS to reporting these questions
for the first three questions (life satisfaction, doing worthwhile things, and
happiness yesterday) the headline figure is the percentage rating from 7 to 10,
for the fourth question (anxiety yesterday) the headline figure is the
percentage rating from 6 to 10.

### Wellbeing indexes

The *PERMA Index* uses 5 questions from the People Survey to measure the extent
to which employees are 'flourishing' in the workplace, it is inspired by
[Martin Seligman's *Flourish* (2011)](https://openlibrary.org/books/OL26883658M/Flourish).

The *Proxy Stress Index* uses 8 questions from the People Survey and aligns
with the Health and Safety Executive's
[*Management Standards*](https://www.hse.gov.uk/stress/standards/index.htm) and
[*Stress Indicator Tool*](https://books.hse.gov.uk/stress-indicator-tool-sit).
