The main results for the Civil Service are the
[benchmark results](../index.qmd), this is the median of participating
organisation scores. The figures presented here are the unweighted mean
scores for all respondents. These results are heavily dominated by the
views of civil servants in the very largest organisations. Staff at the
Department for Work and Pensions, HM Revenue and Customs, the Ministry of
Defence, the Ministry of Justice and the Home Office account for around
two-thirds of all Civil Servants[^size].

[^size]: According to
  [Civil Service Statistics 2025](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/civil-service-statistics-2025)
  these five organisations (Department for Work and Pensions, HM Revenue and
  Customs, the Ministry of Defence, the Ministry of Justice and the Home
  Office, including their agencies) have a total headcount of
  372,180 out of a total UK Civil Service headcount of 549,660.
